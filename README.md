### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: How did this philosophy evolved through the years? How hard is it to read Philosophy?
+ This project is conducted by Shuangxian Li

+ Project summary: The term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In this blog, we want to talk about how these philosophy thoughts changed during the time. We will find the key themes of various 13 schools and their similarities and their influence on each other. Besides, the difficulty level of reading philosophy texts are worth analyzing in order to classify those works into various people.
